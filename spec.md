This repo is for the ProtonMail CLI tool built with Go, It will piggyback off the ProtonMail bridge, which should be already set up on the machine for IMAP access to secure email. The purpose of the CLI is for browsing email in the terminal. Basic operations such as read, write, and delete and then obviously moving messages around but also to help agents, AI agents such as Claude Code and/or Open CLAW So the help menu should be extensive and have a JSON parameter for outputting all the help via JSON so the agent knows how to use the CLI properly
